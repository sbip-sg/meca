# Payment

## UI

Host the ui locally with `http-server .` and access it at `http://localhost:8080/`. This gives an example of how users pay to the account.
Withdraw with the API.

## Development

Using ganache, the first account is the owner of the contracts and also executes the methods. Thus, gas fees are required and to avoid confusion we recommend using another account to pay and withdraw.
